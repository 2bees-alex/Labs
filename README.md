Scaling, marketing, sales etc &amp; forward thinking for VR Sites

This is where I want to start creating a business plan for VR Sites - it is private on GitHub so please presume confidential.

Once this is padded out enough I'm fairly happy to have this as an open business plan - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_business

It will be very ad-hoc! 

Need to start somewhere so I'm basing the structure on the business plan section of Wikipedia.
